You can either clone this repository and work locally on your notebook or work in Google Colab. Locally, we advise you to create a conda environment or a virtual environment. In this, you need to install notebook, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, scikit-survival, and seaborn. 
You can, e.g., do this with: 
```
python3 -m venv myvenv
source myvenv/bin/activate
pip install notebook pandas numpy scikit-learn scikit-survival matplotlib seaborn
```

On Colab, only scikit-survival is not installed. You can install it by inserting a line: 
```
!pip install scikit-survival
```
You can upload the data on the left (folder icon).
